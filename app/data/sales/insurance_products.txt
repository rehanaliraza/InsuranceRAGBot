### Needs Assessment Questions

4. "What assets are most important for you to protect?"
5. "Have you experienced any significant life changes recently?"

- **"I'll think about it"**: Acknowledge hesitation, but emphasize risks of delay.
- **"I already have coverage"**: Offer a free review to identify gaps or opportunities for savings.
- **"I'm healthy, I don't need it"**: Explain that insurance is most affordable when healthy.
- **"I can self-insure"**: Discuss the efficiency of risk transfer versus saving for worst-case scenarios.
